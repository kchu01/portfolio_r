# Portfolio

Welcome to my one-page portfolio that is scalable to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices! It's currently in development but stay tuned. <br />
This portfolio was developed with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Components and Wireframes

* Simple layout style with a sticky navbar that scrolls along when a user interacts with it 
* When a user clicks on a link, it should direct them to that section of the portfolio
* Should be scalable and compatible to all forms of devices
